  //A step value of zero implies a continuous range of values. Ideally, the step
  //would be less than or equal to the distance between the bounds, as well as an
  //even multiple of the distance between the bounds, but neither are required.
  //
  //If the absolute value of the step is larger than or equal to the distance
  //between the two bounds, then the bounds will be the only valid values. e.g. if
  //the range is defined as {from_value: 1, to_value: 2, step: 5} then the valid
  //values will be 1 and 2.
  //
  //If the step is less than the distance between the bounds, but the distance is
  //not a multiple of the step, then the "to" bound will always be a valid value,
  //e.g. if the range is defined as {from_value: 2, to_value: 5, step: 2} then
  //the valid values will be 2, 4, and 5.
