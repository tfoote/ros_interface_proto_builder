//Representation of state for joints with multiple degrees of freedom,
// following the structure of JointState which can only represent a single degree of freedom.
// 
// It is assumed that a joint in a system corresponds to a transform that gets applied
// along the kinematic chain. For example, a planar joint (as in URDF) is 3DOF (x, y, yaw)
// and those 3DOF can be expressed as a transformation matrix, and that transformation
// matrix can be converted back to (x, y, yaw)
// 
// Each joint is uniquely identified by its name
// The header specifies the time at which the joint states were recorded. All the joint states
// in one message have to be recorded at the same time.
// 
// This message consists of a multiple arrays, one for each part of the joint state.
// The goal is to make each of the fields optional. When e.g. your joints have no
// wrench associated with them, you can leave the wrench array empty.
// 
// All arrays in this message should have the same size, or be empty.
// This is the only way to uniquely associate the joint name with the correct
// states.
