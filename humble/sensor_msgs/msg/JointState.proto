//This is a message that holds data to describe the state of a set of torque controlled joints.
// 
// The state of each joint (revolute or prismatic) is defined by:
//  * the position of the joint (rad or m),
//  * the velocity of the joint (rad/s or m/s) and
//  * the effort that is applied in the joint (Nm or N).
// 
// Each joint is uniquely identified by its name
// The header specifies the time at which the joint states were recorded. All the joint states
// in one message have to be recorded at the same time.
// 
// This message consists of a multiple arrays, one for each part of the joint state.
// The goal is to make each of the fields optional. When e.g. your joints have no
// effort associated with them, you can leave the effort array empty.
// 
// All arrays in this message should have the same size, or be empty.
// This is the only way to uniquely associate the joint name with the correct
// states.
